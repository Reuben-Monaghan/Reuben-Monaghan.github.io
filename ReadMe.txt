My Shopping List application repository.

This is my first GitHub repository for my first project, a shopping list app written in Python.
The goal is to create an app that allows me to select several recipes and 
generate a list of the required ingredients and quantit:diffg REies.

To use, update the global file-path at the beginning of the code.

Features:
-Selection of recipes and creation of a shopping list .txt file.
-Addition and deletion of recipes.


This is an ongoing project with plenty of scope for additions and improvements.
Future Features:
-Selected recipe names at the top of the shopping list
-Editing of stored recipes
-Randomly generated recipe selections
-Connection to online recipe databases
-Importing of new recipes from URLs

My Shopping List application repository.

This is my first GitHub repository for my first project, a shopping list app written in Python.
The goal is to create an app that allows me to select several recipes and generate a list of the required ingredients and quantities.

Shopping-List was my first attempt, this uses an excel file to store recipe information.

To use, update the global file-path at the beginning of the code and save as a .py file.

Features:
-Selection of recipes and creation of a shopping list .txt file.
-Addition and deletion of recipes.


This is an ongoing project with plenty of scope for additions and improvements.
Future Aims:
-Editing of stored recipes
-Selected recipe names at the top of the shopping list
-Randomly generated recipe selections
-Connection to online recipe databases
-Importing of new recipes from URLs
